# Simple Chan

A very barebone textboard made using the standard JRE libraries for everything except the logging.

## Why 

The goal of this project was to make the simplest "functional" and extensible imageboard I could possibly do.

## Features <sub><sup><sub>or lack thereof</sub></sup></sub>

### Present

* Multiple boards per instance
* No storage usage (Everything stays in memory)

### Missing

Here is a list of the missing features compared to more mainstream textboard solutions.

* Images
* Rate-limiting
* Captchas
* Auto thread pruning
* Admin controls

All these features haven't been implemented in order to keep the project as simple as possible.
